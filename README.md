# MakeChangeProject

# Description

This project is about creating a functioning cash register that accepts an inputted price of the users item, the tender amount they are paying for the item, and an appopriate response message with either the change tendered or error should it not cover the cost of the item. It will return your change in the greatest denominations possible from $20 down to singular cents.

# Technologies Used

Java, Eclipse

# Lessons Learned

How to have more fun than possible while coding a cash register in Java. The edge cases I found proved to make this task rather dificult. I think that next time I would take a different approach to the problem. I seem to have suffered from the sunk cost fallacy and really committed to this code, which may have been a mistake. I do believe, however, that I have succeeded in making it work. I suppose we shall see if I am right.
